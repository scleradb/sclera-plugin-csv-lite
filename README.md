# Sclera - CSV Connector - Lite

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scleradb/sclera-plugin-csv-lite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scleradb/sclera-plugin-csv-lite)

Enables Sclera to work with [CSV format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) data.

The CSV files are viewed as tables, and can be accessed in a manner similar to tables in a SQL query. You can also join the CSV file with tables in your database, with other CSV files, and aggregate the data as needed.

This is lightweight clone of [Sclera - CSV Connector](https://scleradb.com/docs/sclerasql/sqlextdataaccess/#sclera-csv), meant to showcase Sclera's ability to interface with external data. For the implementation details, please see the [Sclera Data Access Connector Development](https://scleradb.com/docs/sdk/sdkextdataaccess/) document.
